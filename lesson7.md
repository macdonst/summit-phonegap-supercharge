## Overview
If you are anything like me you are CSS challenged and the design you dream up in your head:

<img class="screenshot-md" src="images/vangogh1.png"/>

doesn't always match what you produce in reality.

Luckily, some very intelligent folks who are way better at design have already done the hard work and developed some excellent frameworks we can pick up and use. Let's investigate a few of them.

## Frameworks

### Ionic

**Pros**

* Enables you to utilize a single command for performing actions like creating, developing, testing and deploying your application on to a specific mobile platform.
* The framework is backed by a huge community.
* Ionic contains a powerful CLI with tons of features.
* Is continuously updated according to the latest trends, which helps in creating an app that addresses the need of new generation users.

**Cons**

* To build complex hybrid apps, you'll have to use AngularJS. The problem is: not all the developers are familiar with AngularJS. Moreover, the steep learning curve of AngularJS makes it challenging for novice developers to use Ionic

### Onsen

Onsen UI is an open-source UI framework and components for HTML5 hybrid mobile app development, based on PhoneGap/Apache Cordova. It allows developers to create mobile apps using Web technologies like CSS, HTML5, and JavaScript. Onsen UI is JavaScript framework-agnostic, meaning developers can create mobile apps with pure JavaScript, AngularJS, Angular 2, React, Vue.js and Meteor.

**Pros**

* Developers are given multiple options when including UI components into an app.
* It features a plethora of ready-to-use and responsive components, enabling you to build hybrid apps for Smartphones, tablets and desktop devices.
* Help write applications using HTML5 and JS web technologies, and help those apps deliver native-like experience by utilizing Cordova (and Phonegap) tool.

**Cons**

* The framework limits developers to use the Onsen UI framework features. That's because, developers can't use the features unless they make use of Onsen UI's HTML-based IDE.
