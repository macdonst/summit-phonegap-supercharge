## Overview
If you are anything like me you are CSS challenged and the design you dream up in your head:

<img class="screenshot-md" src="images/vangogh1.png"/>

doesn't always match what you produce in reality.

Luckily, some very intelligent folks who are way better at design have already done the hard work and developed some excellent frameworks we can pick up and use. Let's investigate a few of them.

## Frameworks

### Ionic

### Onsen

Onsen UI is an open-source UI framework and components for HTML5 hybrid mobile app development, based on PhoneGap/Apache Cordova. It allows developers to create mobile apps using Web technologies like CSS, HTML5, and JavaScript. Onsen UI is JavaScript framework-agnostic, meaning developers can create mobile apps with pure JavaScript, AngularJS, Angular 2, React, Vue.js and Meteor.
